# Hello-world1
back to github again, learn how to use it again

I am Phd student who is now doing research related to obesity and diabetes. Biology experiments contains plenty of repetitive, tedious work which may not pay off later since there are so many uncertainties. Therefore, to promise later I would have job selection freedom if I do not want to do biology anymore, I start to learn some popular skills like coding to help myself. Good luck!:)
